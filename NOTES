The setMaps() data belongs in an external file, not inside the code.

Need to configure set priority for determining which cards
are needed from which set. This should probably be in an external
file as well.

Perhaps one XML file for the set data that also indicates priority.
If I went with this approach, I would want a method for displaying
this information in human readable form. Such as a list of all set
codes and their full names. Or, the list of sets ordered by priority.

git push origin master
