To get the list of split cards run:
http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=standard&name=name=+[//]

Note that each card will appear twice in the results.
You can only get the split card names in the format "Name1 // Name2"
with the standard display.

So, we basically need to create a database of all the split cards
so that we do the right thing when generating card sets.
