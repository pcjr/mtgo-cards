Updated Storage::set() to check for uniqueness.
Finish mc_flipcards() and Gatherer::flipcards()


	Multiple copies of flip cards are going into the set data. For example, see mcdata/set_BOK.xml
	for gid 74671 (Cunning Bandit and Azamuki, Treachery Incarnate). Need to clean this up when
	reading from Gatherer.

	The flip cards appear in ()'s after the "real" card name when viewed in Standard format from
	Gatherer.

	To find flip cards:
	http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?name=+%5Bflip%5D%7C%7Ctype=+%5Bflip%5D%7C%7Csubtype=+%5Bflip%5D%7C%7Ctext=+%5Bflip%5D&format=%5B%22Kamigawa%20Block%22%5D

	To generate Flip card index, search this in Gatherer:
	http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=standard&text=+[flip]&format=[%22Kamigawa%20Block%22]

	Format contains: Kamigawa Block
	Text contains: flip
	Display: Standard

	Look for all names with () in them. Ignore all others.

Eliminate setMaps() now that we have sets.txt. Create new sub-command
for consuming this file and generating set code maps and priority maps.
